# Malnutrition Risk Forecasting Using Economic Indicators

## Problem Statement
Malnutrition remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Traditional approaches rely on retrospective data and lack early-warning capabilities.

## Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts malnutrition risk using macroeconomic indicators such as food prices, inflation, GDP per capita, and unemployment.

## Data Sources
- World Bank
- FAO
- WHO
- UNICEF

## Methodology
- Data collection and preprocessing from multiple global datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis
- Feature selection based on statistical relevance
- Random Forest regression model training and evaluation
- Model explainability using SHAP values

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
